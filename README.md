# README Generator

## Overview

The README Generator is a command-line application that generates a professional `README.md` file for your projects. It automates the process of creating a README file by prompting the user for information about their project and then dynamically generating the README based on the user's input.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface with intuitive prompts.
- **Dynamic Generation**: Automatically generates sections such as Description, Installation, Usage, License, etc.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Outputs a well-formatted `README.md` file in Markdown syntax.
- **Save Time**: Eliminates the need to manually create a README file from scratch.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd repo
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

5. **Follow Prompts**: Answer the prompts to provide information about your project.

6. **Generated README**: Once all prompts are completed, the application will generate a `README.md` file in the same directory.
